      <h3>Effect of Weather changes on different industries</h3>
      <p>
       <b>A)	Insurance</b> <br>
Insurance is important for the case of natural hazards like floodings or hails as they impose extra burdens over the insurance companies as people claim for their losses.
      </p>
      <p>
        List of major floods happened in Australia:<br>
<b>Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floods_in_Australia</b><br>
a)	March 2010, QLD, Day: 2/03/2010  “The calm before the storm” <br>
<br>
<b>Observations: </b><br>
1.	Temperature difference on the flood day is the minimum, <br>
2.	Rainfall exceeded the evaporation and there were two same days within the last 30 days, <br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion: </b><br>
Flooding happened as evaporation did not perform completely and the soil was already saturated with previous rainfalls. <br>
<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> <br>
	Invest money to make the soil dry like making canals, implementing drainage network, dams, waterways for surface water guidance<br>
b)	 Dec 2010 – Jan 2011, QLD, Feb 2022, NSW<br>
<br>
<b>Observations:</b> <br>
1.	The same as before in Townsville and Brisbane: frequent rainy day before the flood, all values higher than evaporation, <br>
General recommendations: <br>
Frequency of flooding in eastern states are higher as there are days that rainfall exceeds evaporation. General recommendations should be applied in these states. <br>
Mulching is not a good practice in this state! <br>

<br>
<b>B)	Agriculture</b><br>
The Agriculture in Australia is affected by droughts and rainfalls. The Agricultural produce affects the living costs and other things in the supply chain. <br>
Record of the droughts in Australia in 21st Century: <br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought_in_Australia<br>
The records of the drought shows that Alice springs is one of the places with minimum rainfall in Australia. Even old stories confirm that: <br>
https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3976579
The climate change in Australia is highly affected by El Nino effect. Eastern states experienced drought seasons before flooding periods.  <br>
<br>
<b>Recommendation </b><br>
1.	Bamboos, gingers, cannas, swamp lilies, sedges, tarrow, rainforest palms, banana and yams are all plants that can cope with both wet and dry conditions.<br>
2.	Reducing the greenhouse emission will help regulating the climate<br>
3.	Lima beans,Pole beans,Corn,Cowpeas, black-eyed peas and field peas,Edible amaranth,Quinoa, Mustard greens, Okra are crops which can be cultivated in drought areas.

<br>
<b>C)	Bushfires</b><br>
The list of Main Australian Bushfires might be seen below: <br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_bushfires_in_Australia<br>
No.1: 2-9 January 2015; SA, <br>
No.2: 1-9 August 2015, NSW (Winter BushFire) <br>
<br>
<b>Observations: </b><br>
1.	Small difference between the minimum and maximum temperature during a day, <br>
2.	High Pressure system of air in a few days before the incident that means stability of the weather, <br>
3.	No rain and maximum evaporation during a week period. <br>
4.	During the Winter bushfire, again we had an abnormal maximum temperature (24.7 C) with lower temperature difference during the day and maximum evaporation. <br>
5.	For a few days later, (August 22), we have another peak in temperature (28.3 C) and temperature difference is also low which means prone condition for bushfire. But it didn’t happen as the soil was wet due to a small rainfall some days before (17 August) and low evaporation during preceding days. <br>
<br>
<b>Recommendations:</b> <br>
Investing money to keep the soil wet or disconnect between the very dry areas<br>
